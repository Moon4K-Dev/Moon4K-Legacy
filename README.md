# How to add custom songs and charts?

* Make a folder in the "charts" folder with your song name
* add the audio for the song and add it to the folder (IT HAS TO BE NAMED music.ogg!)
* make the chart or convert a fnf chart and add it to the folder
* copy the songInfo.json from test, paste it into your song folder and edit it
* add a "image.png" or "video.mp4" if you wanna have a custom background (If you're doing a video make sure it has no audio or remove the audio from it.)
